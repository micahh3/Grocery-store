    <h1>Micah's Totally Tubular About Me Website!!!</h1>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello my name is Micah. I am a 16yo digital and traditional artist with a love for unusualness and comedy. 
        I love photography, drawing, watching movies, and music! 
        I would say my artistic journey began when I was around 7 years old and loved painting and making comics.</p>
        <p>I continued my artistic journey through middle school when I went Oakland School for the Arts (OSA) and joined the Media Arts department where I found my love for digital art and photography.
        Since attending OSA I have directed four short films/bumpers, found a love for animation and photography, and learned more about my artistic process.
        This site is a way for me to express, well me!</p>
        <p>For now I just have this homepage and my digital art but I plan to create three more pages where I have a diary of the media
        (movies, shows, and youtube videos) that I consume, along with a page where I talk about musical artists I like and a page where I trash talk videogames I love playing.</p>
